## Usage
Cloning the repository should be done by using `git clone --recursive git@github.com:JBAMeijer/Typhoon.git`. \
This makes sure that you also clone all the submodules.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
